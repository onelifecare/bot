# Field Mapping — Runtime v1

Source: `OneLifeCare_Master_Sheet_v24_runtime_ready.xlsx`

Legend:
- **RT-R** = Runtime reads this field
- **RT-W** = Runtime writes this field
- **DB-R** = Dashboard reads this field
- **DB-W** = Dashboard writes this field
- **—** = not used by the marked side

Only fields that matter to runtime v1 are listed in detail. Fields not in the list still exist in the tab but are either dashboard-only or reserved for future use.

> **Doctrine binding (see `runtime_spec_v1.md § 1.A`):** every RT-R field below is a value the runtime consumes as-is from the dashboard/sheet — the AI may choose **which** row to use and **how** to frame it, but never invents the value itself. Price, offer name, components, shipping, health action, variant reply text, persona identity: all sourced, never synthesised.
